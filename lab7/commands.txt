mpicc basicprogram.c -o basicprogram
mpirun -np 4 ./basicprogram


//here -np shows number of processes 
//mpicc ==> to compile the program using mpicc compiler
//mpirun ==> to run the program


mpirun -np 2 send_receive
mpicc send_receive.c -o send_receive

MPI_Send & MPI_Receive ==> blocking communications ==> they stop until the data is sent or received

MPI_Isend & MPI_Irecv ==> non-blocking communications ==> they return immediately and then receive or send the data asynchronously
